# Hybrid Fuzzy Deep Neural Network (HFDNN) for Classification

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Hybrid Fuzzy Deep Neural Network (HFDNN)** for classification tasks, combining the benefits of both fuzzy logic and deep learning. The HFDNN model integrates **fuzzy rules** generated by a Gaussian membership function with **neural network layers** to improve performance on complex classification problems. This hybrid approach allows the model to learn from both fuzzy and neural network-based knowledge, making it more versatile and capable of handling uncertain or ambiguous data.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combines fuzzy logic and deep neural networks for classification.
- **Gaussian Membership Functions**: Used for fuzzy rule generation based on input features.
- **ReLU Activation**: Utilizes ReLU for hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.
- **Fusion Layer**: Fuses fuzzy and neural network outputs to improve decision-making.
- **Softmax Output**: Applies softmax activation to convert raw outputs into class probabilities for multi-class classification.
- **Backpropagation**: Implements backpropagation for training, updating weights using gradient descent.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Uses cross-entropy loss for training, making the model suitable for classification tasks.

## Components of the Model

### 1. **Gaussian Membership Function**
   - A function that calculates the degree of membership for each input feature based on a Gaussian distribution. This function helps define fuzzy rules that capture the relationship between input features and output classes.

### 2. **Neural Layers**
   - Each layer in the HFDNN uses fully connected layers with **ReLU activation** to introduce non-linearity. The forward propagation process computes the output of each layer, and the backward propagation updates the weights using the gradient of the loss function.

### 3. **Fuzzy Rules**
   - The fuzzy rules are generated based on the Gaussian membership function applied to input features. Each rule represents a fuzzy relationship between input features and output classes, contributing to the decision-making process.

### 4. **Fusion Layer**
   - This layer combines the fuzzy and neural network outputs by applying weighted sums. The fusion of these two types of knowledge allows the network to benefit from both fuzzy logic and deep learning methods, making it more robust and adaptable to various types of data.

### 5. **Softmax Output**
   - A softmax function is applied to the final output to transform the network's raw outputs into probabilities, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.

### 6. **Loss Functions**
   - The model uses **Cross-Entropy Loss** for training. This is commonly used for classification problems and helps the network learn the optimal parameters by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual labels.

### 7. **Accuracy and Performance Evaluation**
   - The model's performance is evaluated using **accuracy** and **loss** metrics. These metrics help determine how well the model generalizes to unseen data, providing insights into potential overfitting or underfitting during training.

## Training and Evaluation

### Data Preprocessing
   - The input data is preprocessed by:
     - Normalizing feature data using **StandardScaler**.
     - One-hot encoding the target labels using **OneHotEncoder**.

### Model Training
   - The **HFDNN** model is trained on the preprocessed data. The training involves forward propagation through the layers, backpropagation for weight updates, and the calculation of the **Cross-Entropy Loss**.
   - The training process includes evaluating the model on the validation set and adjusting weights through backpropagation.

### Performance Evaluation
   - The model is evaluated on the **test dataset**, and performance metrics such as **test loss** and **test accuracy** are calculated to assess the final model's generalization ability.

### Visualization
   - The loss and accuracy curves for both training and validation sets are plotted to visualize the training progress and help detect issues like overfitting or underfitting.

## Conclusion
